<p>Panhala fort (also known as Panhalgad and Panhalla (literally "the home of serpents")), is located in Panhala, 20 kilometres northwest of Kolhapur in Maharashtra, India. It is strategically located looking over a pass in the Sahyadri mountain range which was a major trade route from Bijapur in the interior of Maharashtra to the coastal areas.[1] Due to its strategic location, it was the centre of several skirmishes in the Deccan involving the Marathas, the Mughals and the British East India Company, the most notable being the Battle of Pavan Khind. Here, the queen regent of Kolhapur, Tarabai Ranisaheb, spent her formative years. Several parts of the fort and the structures within are still intact. It is also called as the 'Fort of Snakes' as it is zigzagged in shape.</p><br>
<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>Panahala fort was built between 1178 and 1209 CE, one of 15 forts (others including Bavda, Bhudargad, Satara, and Vishalgad) built by the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II. It is said that aphorism Kahaan Raja Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli is associated with this fort. A copper plate found in Satara shows that Raja Bhoja held court at Panhala from 1191–1192 CE. About 1209–10, Bhoja Raja was defeated by Singhana (1209–1247), the most powerful of the Devgiri Yadavas, and the fort subsequently passed into the hands of the Yadavas. Apparently it was not well looked after and it passed through several local chiefs. In 1376 inscriptions record the settlement of Nabhapur to the south-east of the fort.
It was an outpost of the Bahamanis of Bidar. Mahmud Gawan, an influential prime minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469. On the establishment of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur in 1489, Panhala came under Bijapur and was fortified extensively. They built the strong ramparts and gateways of the fort which, according to tradition, took a hundred years to build. Numerous inscriptions in the fort refer to the reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah, probably Ibrahim I (1534–1557).</p><br>
<h4>UNDER CHH.SHIVAJI MAHARAJ</h4>
<p>In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the ensuing confusion Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took Panhala from Bijapur.[5] In May 1660, to win back the fort from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Adil Shah II (1656–1672) of Bijapur sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar to lay siege to Panhala. Shivaji Raje fought back and they could not take the fort. The siege continued for 5 months, at the end of which all provisions in the fort were exhausted and Shivaji Raje was on the verge of being captured.

Under these circumstances, Shivaji Raje decided that escape was the only option. He gathered a small number of soldiers along with his trusted commander Veer Baji Prabhu Deshpande and, on 13 July 1660,[6] they escaped in the dead of night to flee to Vishalgad. Veer Baji Prabhu and a barber, veer Shiva Kashid, who looked like Shivaji Raje, kept the enemy engaged, giving them an impression that veer Shiva Kashid was actually Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In the ensuing battle (see Battle of Pavan Khind), almost three quarters of the one thousand strong force died, including Veer Baji Prabhu himself.[7][8] The fort went to Adil Shah. It was not until 1673 that Shivaji Raje could occupy it permanently.

Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's son and successor to the throne Shivaji Raje met his brave son after he escaped from the Camp of Diler Khan after executing his father political agenda to bring Aurangzeb's successor over to the Maratha's.[9] He escaped from here along with his wife on 13 December 1678[10] and attacked Bhupalgad. He returned to Panhala, however, on 4 December 1679 to reconcile with his father[10] just before his father's death on 4 April 1680. At the height of Shivaji's power in 1678, Panhala housed 15,000 horses and 20,000 soldiers.[11] also the main darwaza was chaar darwaza</p><br>
<h3>MAJOR FEATURES</h3>
<p>It is one of the largest forts in the Deccan, with a perimeter of 14 km (9 mi) and 110 lookout posts. It is 845 m (2,772 ft) above sea level.[17] This fort is built on the Sahyadris, rising more than 400 m (1,312 ft) above its surrounding plain. Numerous tunnels stretch out from underneath the fort, one of which is almost 1 km long.[14] Most of the architecture is of the Bijapuri style with the peacock motif of the Bahmani Sultanate prominently visible on several structures. Some of the older bastions also have the lotus motif of Bhoja II. There are several monuments at the fort which are considered notable by the Archaeological Survey of India.More than 7 km of fortifications (Tatabandi) define the approximately triangular zone of Panhala fort. The walls are protected for long sections by steep escarpments, reinforced by a parapet with slit holes. The remaining sections have 5–9 m (16–30 ft) high ramparts without a parapet, strengthened by round bastions the most notable of which is Rajdindi. </p><br>
<h4>ANDHAR BAVADI</h4><image src="andhar.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
<p>Whenever an army besieged a fort, their first action was to poison the main water source of the fort. To counter this, Adil Shah commissioned the building of the Andhar Bavadi (Hidden Well).[14] This is a three-storey structure[19] with winding staircases that conceal the well which was the main water source for Panhala fort. There are recesses in the wall so that soldiers can be permanently stationed. Several hidden escape routes in the Andhar Bavai lead outside the fort. With its own water source, living quarters and its own exit routes, likely this structure was designed like a fort within a fort with the intention of making it an emergency shelter in case the main fort fell.</p><br>
<h4>KALAVANTICHA MAHAL</h4><image src="kalavanti.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
<p>The name of this building, which is also called Nayakini Sajja, literally means "Courtesans' Terrace room". It stands on the east side of the fort close to the rampart. By 1886, it had become a complete wreck with only traces of ornamental work on the ceiling.[3] This was used during the occupation of the fort by the Bahmani Sultanate as a Rang Mahal[21](residences for the ladies of the court</p><br>
<h4>AMBARKHANA</h4><image src="ambarkhana.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
<p>The Amberkhana, situated in the center of the fort, were three granaries built in the Bijapuri style of architecture. They enabled Shivaji to withstand a 5-month siege by Siddhi Johar.[21] It consists of three buildings called the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati Kothis. The Ganga kothi, which was the largest, had a capacity of 25,000 khandis[23] (with one khandi being 650 lbs). It covers an area of 950 sq m and is 10.5 m high.[24] Rice, nachni and warai were the major provisions stored.[19] Stairs on both sides lead the top of the buildings. It has sixteen bays each with its own flat vault with a hole on top through which grain used to be passed.[3] The eastern entrance has a domed chamber with a balcony and plasterwork of the Bijapuri style.</p><br>
<h4>SAJJA KOTHI</h4><image src="sajja.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
<p>Sajja Kothi is a one-storey structure built by Ibrahim Adil Shah in 1500 CE.[26] It is also built in the Bijapuri style. Sajja Kothi was constructed as a viewing pavilion looking over the valley below. The domed upper chambers have faceted pendentives with the balconies hanging over the ramparts of the fort.</p><br>
