This historic lake features a Hindu temple with a Nandi.[1] According to local Hindu beliefs, Lord Shiva uses the Nandi, moves a single wheat grain towards the lake, and backs about a distance of single rice grain daily. Hindu beliefs state that if Lord Shiva reaches Rankala, the apocalypse will begin.</p><br>
